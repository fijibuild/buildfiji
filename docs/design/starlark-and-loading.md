# Starlark, loading and bzlmod

## Compatibility bar
- Parse and evaluate all Starlark that Bazel accepts, including Bazel
  dialect quirks (no `def` in BUILD, `load()` semantics, `native`).
- Bazel builtins: `rule`, `aspect`, `provider`, `attr.*`, `select`,
  `configuration_field`, `exec_group`, `toolchain_type`, `ctx.actions.*`,
  `ctx.actions.args()`, `depset`, `struct`, `json`, `proto`, `visibility`,
  `package_group`, `glob`, `exports_files`, `licenses`, `Label`.
- bzlmod: `MODULE.bazel`, `bazel_dep`, `use_extension`, `use_repo`,
  `single_version_override`, registries (BCR), `MODULE.bazel.lock`,
  module extensions, repository rules (`repository_ctx`).
- Legacy `WORKSPACE` is out of scope (Bazel 9 removes it).

## Parser performance
The `starlark` crate is the default. If profiling on large repos shows the
parser dominating loading time, replace the front end with a lexer generated
by [regal](https://github.com/NathanHowell/regal) (build-time minimal DFA,
incremental relexing for the server/`--watchfs` case) and a hand-written
recursive-descent parser targeting the existing `starlark_syntax` AST, so
the evaluator and all builtins are untouched.

## Test strategy
Run Bazel's own Starlark test corpus and the `starlark-spec` test files;
run `rules_rust`, `rules_go`, `rules_python`, `aspect_bazel_lib` loading
phase as integration tests and diff `fjfj query` against `bazel query`.

## No native modules (decision 2026-09-03)

fjfj implements no native Starlark modules. `cc_common`, `java_common`,
`proto_common`, `apple_common`, `platform_common` and `coverage_common` are
written in Starlark, either shipped by fjfj as a builtins overlay (the
equivalent of Bazel's `@_builtins`) or provided by the rules themselves.
Rust implements only the core language plus the rule, aspect, provider,
`ctx`, `Args`, depset, transition, toolchain and exec-group primitives, and
those must be complete enough to express the native modules in Starlark.

## Label character rules and path representation (decision 2026-09-03)

Package names and target names follow Bazel's own `LabelValidator`
exactly (`fjfj_graph::label`), not a plausible-looking approximation, and
the two are asymmetric on purpose: a package name is ASCII-only, but a
target name additionally allows any non-ASCII character — Bazel treats
every code point above U+007F as automatically legal in a target name, so
a source file with a non-ASCII name (a common case for localized test
fixtures) is not an edge case to reject (buildfiji-mum.18).

Once real filesystem code exists (globbing, package loading, the
execroot), paths are `PathBuf`/`OsString`, never `String`: a Unix path is
an arbitrary byte sequence with no UTF-8 guarantee, and Windows paths
carrying more than `MAX_PATH` (260 UTF-16 units) need the `\\?\`
extended-length prefix, which only applies to well-formed `OsString`
paths, not to a `String` that has already lost the platform's native
encoding. Label validation (above) stays on `&str`, since labels are
Bazel-language identifiers with a defined character set, not filesystem
paths.
